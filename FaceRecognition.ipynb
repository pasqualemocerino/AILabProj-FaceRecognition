        "Face Recogniton is a form of biometrics, the science which deals with the automated recognition of individuals based on biological and behavioral characteristics. It is included in physiological or static biometrics, based on data derived from the measurement of a part of a person's anatomy.\n",

        "Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) is an image dataset containing face photographs, collected especially for studying the problem of unconstrained face recognition. It includes over 13,000 images of faces collected from across the web. Here are key aspects of these images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each face in this data set was labeled with the personâ€™s name in the image.\n",
        "1680 of the photographed persons distinctly appear in two or more photos in the data set.\n",
        "The faces in these images were detected by the Viola-Jones face detector (Paul Viola and Michael Jones, 2001).\n",
        "\n",
        "LFW includes four different sets of images, including the original and three types of aligned images that can be used to test algorithms under different conditions. For alignment, the dataset uses funneled images (ICCV 2007), LFW-a, and deep funneled images (NIPS 2012). Deep funneled and LFW-a images produce superior results for most face verification algorithms over the funneled images and the original images.\n",
        "\n",
        "Face Recognition is a task typically performed on the output of a model trained to perform Face Detection. The most popular model for Face Detection is called Viola-Jones and is implemented in the OpenCV library. The LFW faces were extracted by this face detector from various online websites."
